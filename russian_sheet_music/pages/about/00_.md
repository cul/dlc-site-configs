A collection of Russian and early Soviet music scores published from 1904 to 1938. Numerous composers and lyricists (primarily Russian but also European and American) are represented. Most scores were published in Moscow or Leningrad. Other imprints include Rostov-na-Donu, Kiev, Kharʹkov, and Tiflis. Most scores are popular music, jazz or dance music. The covers were designed by many different artists. The collection includes musical settings of poems by Esenin, Lebedev-Kumach and Mayakovsky among others.

Visually, many of the cover sheets are quite striking, and reflect a variety of
styles, ranging widely from World of Art, to Cubo-Futurism; “orientalism,” to
Constructivism; Abstraction, to Socialist Realism. The collection directly
complements Columbia’s extensive holdings of modernist works on paper as
documented in the catalogue by Robert H. Davis and Megan K. Duncan Smith

The acquisition of this material reflects a long-term effort to build holdings of less-commonly collected graphic material that documents the dynamic artistic and
cultural scene of interwar Eastern and East Central Europe.
