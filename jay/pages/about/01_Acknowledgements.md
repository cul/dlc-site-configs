We are grateful to the many people whose hard work and generosity have made
this project possible. Among these are James Baird (Project Editor, 2000-2002),
Alison Ward, Rose Bautista, Bernard Crystal, Ellen Wurtzel, James Basker,
Theodore Crackel, Janet Gertz, Beryl Abrams, Robert Wolven,  Patricia Renfro,
Mary-Jo Kline, Pat Moran, Kari Smith, and Matt Hampel; Columbia Libraries'
Digital Program and Systems Office staff members Angela Bukowy, David Arjanik,
Roberta Blitz, David Ortiz, Dmitri Laury, Emily Holmes, Stephen P. Davis, Gary
Bertchume and Breck Witte; and the members of the Advisory Board. Alix Schnee,
Alan Weinreb  and the very loyal staff of volunteers at the John Jay Homestead
in Katonah,  New York have also been of great assistance. Michael Hall, at the
National Endowment for the Humanities, gave helpful advice. Financial  help
from the Florence Gould Foundation and the Peck Stacpoole Foundation came at
crucial moments as we moved forward. Elaine Sloan, University Librarian and
Vice President for Information Services, encouraged the  project; her
successor, James Neal, has continued to support it with energy and enthusiasm.


Without the hard work of Richard B. Morris and the many researchers and
assistants who served as his staff over the years, there would have been no
material to digitize. Particular credit must go to Ene Sirvet, Editor of the
Jay papers until 1996, whose efforts on behalf of the Jay papers were
long-lasting and heroic.
