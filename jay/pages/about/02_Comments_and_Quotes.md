**Dr. Richard Bushman, Gouverneur Morris Professor Emeritus of History at
Columbia University, (March 2006):**

> "John Jay is no longer the forgotten founding father. The Columbia Jay Papers
> project has installed a nearly comprehensive collection of the Jay Papers
> manuscript on line for all to peruse. Constant improvements have made the
> site more and more convenient to use. In a time when the founding fathers are
> coming back into a spotlight, we can now get better acquainted with this
> critical contributor to the establishment of the Constitution and the
> beginnings of the new republic."


**Diane Shewchuk, Director of the John Jay Homestead State Historic Site in
Katonah, N.Y (Feb. 2006):**

> "*The Papers of John Jay* is a marvel of accessibility that makes it possible
> for anyone to make detailed searches of documents without having to travel
> to multiple repositories, or spend hours reading page after fragile page
> seeking that one elusive bit of information. It allows one to follow up each
> new discovery quickly with a fresh inquiry, taking one on an investigatory
> odyssey that would be far slower and more difficult without it.”


**Dr. Elizabeth M. Nuxoll, editor of
the new Jay letterpress edition:**

> "All of us will find our work simplified by the improved search capacities
> and revised abstracts now being made available, and enhanced by the addition
> of so many documents to this publicly available database. So too will the
> countless teachers, students, writers, genealogists, and history buffs
> unknown to us, who will log on to explore these varied and fascinating
> documents and to use them as building blocks for the scholarship of the
> future.”
