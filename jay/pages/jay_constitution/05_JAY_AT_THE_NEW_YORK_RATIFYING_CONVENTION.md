####(June-July 1788)
<a name="ratifying"></a>
In the critical battles that lay ahead in the state of New York, the pro-ratification party or Federalists counted themselves fortunate in being able to draw upon Jay's literary and forensic ammunition. On 31 January 1788 New York State Senator Egbert Benson proposed to the state legislature that the delegates to the ratifying convention be chosen in the same number as the state assemblymen by "all free male citizens of the age of twenty-one years and upwards" and that they meet in Poughkeepsie the third Thursday in June. Despite the obstructionist efforts of the Antifederalists and the distinct coolness of their leader, Governor George Clinton, both houses passed the resolution setting elections for the end of April.

Nominees for New York City's delegates were not limited to the two opposing blocs, but were initiated informally and in response to a groundswell of recognition of the quality of the Federalist leadership, notably of Jay. As early as 20 February 1788, Jay's name appeared on a list of candidates offered to "Friends and fellow citizens." After proposing Jay's name, the writer asserted: "From his long services abroad and at home, and the nature of his present office as minister of foreign affairs, [he] must [be] supposed to possess the best information of any man in the United States, on our relative situation with foreign nations." Within a few weeks "An Independent Elector" and "A Citizen" included Jay on their proposed slates. A more formal "Federal Ticket" for New York City and County was proposed on 9 April on behalf of "a number of your fellow citizens" by Thomas Randall, prominent New York merchant and ex-Tory. Others rushed to join in endorsement, including groups styling themselves "mechanics and tradesmen," "a very numerous meeting of Germans, inhabitants of the city," "A Citizen and friend of GOOD ORDER," "a number of your Customers," and a long nominating article including the name of Jay appeared in the press on 22 April.

Laudatory references to Jay were by no means uncommon. A contributor to Childs' _Daily Advertiser_ in the 21 March issue not only included Jay on his own list but, for the benefit of voters who had been out of the city during the war years, added this observation about the Secretary for Foreign Affairs:

> The distinguished abilities, and unshaken integrity of Mr. Jay, recommended him at an early period of life, to all his acquaintance, as well as to the notice of the British Government, in the late Province of New-York, antecedent to the war, insomuch, that he would have been appointed to one of the first offices in that Province, upon the first vacancy that should happen. Nevertheless when the rights of his country became invaded by the British, he took a decided and active part in her favor; his uniform services since, both at home and abroad, particularly in the formation of the Treaty of Peace, so peculiarly advantageous and beneficial to the interest of the United States; in the management and prosecution of which, he had a principal share. Mr. Jay's legal knowledge is incontrovertible; his arguments are methodically arranged and drawn forth with judgment; he reasons logically and well, and excells most men in dissecting the arguments of his opponents and rendering them futile and nugatory; he is able and pointed in reply, and possesses the powers of persuasion in an eminent degree; in short Mr. Jay is endowed with the necessary qualifications to constitute a statesman.

Nominations continued throughout the month of April, including a Federalist rhymester whose doggerel ran:

Jay's name was also included in a nine-man slate adopted at a meeting "of a large number of respectable Mechanics and Tradesmen" assembled late that month at Vandewater's Tavern and chaired by Daniel Dunscomb.

Pro-Jay and pro-Federalist doggerel drew a response from one critic who, in offering a Jay slate, added with obvious sarcasm:

On the eve of the election a group of "Many Federalists" issued a broadside which sought to controvert the anti-lawyer bias of some Antifederalists. They urged the electors "to chuse a less number of Lawyers," perhaps two, and proposed a slate of nine, significantly headed by lawyers John Jay and Alexander Hamilton, but with seven others, principally businessmen. Whether this was in fact a devious tactic of the Antifederalists to alert the voters to the dangers inherent in the proposed Constitution, which permitted the federal judiciary to intermeddle with the state courts, is a distinct possibility. A broadside which casts aspersions on the integrity of the legal profession could hardly be acceptable to a Jay or a Hamilton. Significantly, aside from Hamilton and Jay, none of the remainder of the slate was chosen.

Jay had predicted that the election would be "the most contested of any we have had since the Revolution.” [_Jay to William Bingham, March 24, 1788,_ [12521](/jay/ldpd:500739) (no image)] In New York City, however, that prediction did not prove correct, for there the Antifederalists did not even enter a slate, although some scattered votes were cast for their candidates. Some 2,836 ballots were cast, the largest number yet recorded in a New York City election.

Jay headed the victorious Federalist slate, according to the following votes:

Contrariwise, upstate the Antifederalists scored sweeping victories, giving them a more than two-to-one majority of Convention delegates, but only fifty-six percent of the total vote cast.

Long before the results of the balloting were known Jay realistically appraised the situation as "so formidable that the Issue appears problematical." [_Jay to Washington, April 20, 1788,_ [10395](/jay/ldpd:66948), [8428](/jay/ldpd:54370)] Yet hardly three weeks before the opening of the Poughkeepsie Convention, Jay seems to have worked out the strategy for the Federalist camp. While writing Washington on 29 May that the majority of the delegation comprised "anti-fœderal Characters," he then deleted from his original draft his expression of regret that the election had been delayed as "the Constitution continues [to] gain ground daily." The opposition had used "improper means" to deceive and alarm the people, "and with very considerable Success," but, he added, "Truth is constantly extending and will prevail." In his draft Jay pointed out that these methods had aroused much indignation, that it was doubtful "whether the Leaders will be able to govern the Party," and that "many in the opposition are friends to Union and mean well" while their leaders were "very far from being Sollicitous about the Fate of the Union." The leaders wanted the Constitution rejected swiftly with as little debate as possible, but he doubted whether their followers would take such "desperate" measures. The implication was clear: insist on full debate and divide the opposition on tactics. A second point Jay made was found in the remark that "An Idea has taken air that the Southern part of the State will at all Events adhere to the Union, and if necessary to that End seek a Separation from the northern." That contingency was one of which the opposition was fearful and with which they had no plans to cope. Jay struck out a last observation: "The Truth is," he added, "that few among them are remarkable for talents," but these men "may perhaps occasion" trouble. [_Jay to Washington, May 29, 1788,_ [10397](/jay/ldpd:66936); [8430](/jay/ldpd:54362)]

Jay's observations were indeed shrewd. Instead of deep-seated opposition to the idea of a federal union, there was a fairly general consensus that the Confederation had to be replaced with something better. Bear in mind that New York had been the very first state to propose a general convention to revise the Articles of Confederation and had done so back in July of 1782\. What the more persuadable Antifederalists really sought six years later were assurances that the defects of the proposed Constitution could be remedied. Thus, four days after the Convention met, Jay wrote his wife that the "Proceedings and Debates have been temperate, and inoffensive to either Party," even though, and he underscored this, "_The opposition to the proposed Constitution appears formidable_, the more so from numbers than other Considerations." [_Jay to Sarah Jay, June 21, 1788,_ [5303](/jay/ldpd:35760), [4018](/jay/ldpd:28560) (no images)]

Jay might have added that two days earlier the Federalist strategy that he had outlined in his letter to Washington was set in motion. On June 19th the Convention adopted the resolution offered by Jay's former law partner, Robert R. Livingston, "That no question, general or particular, should be put in the committee upon the proposed Constitution of Government for the United States, or upon any clause or article thereof, nor upon any amendment which should be reposed thereto, until after the said Constitution and amendments should have been considered _clause by clause."_ This, the Jay strategy, would ensure ultimate victory for the Federalists.

From this point on the Constitution was debated article by article, and we are able to pursue Jay's own remarks on the floor of the convention through some half dozen accounts, printed or manuscript. All available reports of the convention are fragmentary. The fullest account was published by Jay's erstwhile protégé, the newspaper printer Francis Childs, who issued a set of _Debates and Proceedings_, which unfortunately lacks a record of debates beyond June 28th and thereafter merely summarizes motions introduced. Supplementing Childs' account is the "Journal of the Proceedings of the Convention" kept by the Convention's secretary, John McKesson, in the New York State Library, as well as his "Notes" in The New-York Historical Society. To fill in the missing gaps, and for comparative purposes, the editors also used Melancton Smith's "Notes" in the State Library, the notes of Gilbert Livingston of Dutchess County, which contain the most complete record for the period beginning July 14th, in the New York Public Library, the fragmentary account by Robert R. Livingston in The New-York Historical Society, and the fragment by Robert Lansing covering June 27-28 in the Genet Papers at the Library of Congress. Finally, the editors have had to take into account contemporary newspaper coverage as well as Jay's correspondence during his weeks at Poughkeepsie.

Jay's early appearance on the floor of the Poughkeepsie Convention caught the fancy of a correspondent for the _New York Daily Advertiser_. Reporting Jay's initial remarks, he wrote under date of 21 June, "After the Chancellor had concluded, Mr. Jay arose, commanding pleasure and satisfaction; and, no doubt, he spoke convincingly on the points raised. He has the most peculiar knack of expressing himself I ever heard. Fancy, passion, in short everything that makes an orator, he is a stranger to; and yet none who hear but are pleased with him, and captivated beyond expression." A gentleman in Poughkeepsie writing to his friend in Connecticut, under date of 26 June, "found Mr. Jay's reasoning" to be "weighty as gold, polished as silver and strong as steel."

From his initial speech on 23 June, in which he examined Article I, section 2, clause 3, supporting the ratio of one representative to 30,000 persons, Jay stressed moderation and persuasion. He continually pointed out areas of agreement with his opponents, such as the need for a strong, energetic federal government (such declarations, he remarked, "came from all parts of the house"), and distinguished between state and federal concerns. He pointed out that the differences between the leader of the opposition bloc on the floor, the amiable Melancton Smith, and himself over the question of proper representation were truly minimal, since Smith was willing to have the federal government possess the important power of war and peace. For the exercise of such great powers Jay was prepared to accept a relatively modest proportional representation in the lower house, while conceding that a much larger one for the state legislature would seem reasonable to deal with internal domestic affairs. The truth, as Jay pointed out, was that state legislatures were concerned with "innumerable things" requiring "such minute and local information." The objectives of the general government were broad, comprehending "the interests of the States in relation to each other, and in relation to foreign powers." We do not require our nation's representatives to possess minute information about Suffolk, or Orange, or Ulster. He himself would have preferred a larger representation, Jay admitted, perhaps similar to what Melancton Smith desired, but because agreements on this figure were so diverse, "I think it best to let things stand as they are," he remarked. "If I could be convinced that danger would probably result from so small a number," he added to the opposition, "I should certainly withhold my acquiescence." Again, a conciliatory peroration: "We did not come here to carry points. If the gentleman will convince me I am wrong, I will submit.... _It is from this reciprocal interchange of ideas, that the truth must come out_."

Two days later Jay rose to reply to Samuel Jones, who opposed giving Congress the power of prescribing the time, place, and manner of holding elections. Jay regarded the Constitutional provision as vital to "prevent the dissolution of the Union" in the event that a state "by design or accident" should fail to choose Senators or Representatives. By this date Jay was able to report to Washington that the complexion of the Convention was about as anticipated, that neither party had really budged the other, and that until the rank and file of the Antifederalists realized that their leadership was anchored to an extreme position no forward movement was likely. Nonetheless, and more significantly, he noted that "the greater number" of the Antifederalists were, in his opinion, "_averse_ to a vote of Rejection." Some would be content with recommendatory amendments; others wished for explanatory amendments to settle points of doubtful construction. Still a third group would insist on amendments precedent to ratification, and were even in favor of adjourning at that time to wait and see how the new government would operate before joining the Union. By this time the ninth state, New Hampshire, had ratified, and the new union was a fait accompli, a fact which had an intangible but significant impact on the course of the Poughkeepsie debates. Jay could now tell Washington that "the people...are gradually coming right notwithstanding the Singular pains taken to prevent it." [_Jay to Washington_, (_ca. June 27, 1788),_ [8431](/jay/ldpd:54356); [10398](/jay/ldpd:66928)]

His relatively optimistic report to Washington notwithstanding, Jay was not sanguine about the outcome, writing to his friend John Vaughan on June 27th that "the issue is uncertain." [_Jay to Vaughan, June 27, 1788,_ [2567](/jay/ldpd:16888); [8144](/jay/ldpd:53576), [8167](/jay/ldpd:53452)] Indeed, Jay had good reason for concern. On the 26th of June John Williams, an upstate delegate, had proposed a resolution denying Congress the power to impose an excise tax on products grown or manufactured in the United States, with strict limitations on direct taxes (in terms almost anticipating California's Proposition 13). Jay would have rushed into the fray at once, save for the fact that for a day or two Hamilton and Lansing were feuding on the floor. Meantime, the opposition had confused issues by raising the point of concurrent powers of the federal government and the states aside from taxation. Jay felt that these observations were "not matured"--we would say "half-baked," but Jay was always polite. He insisted that until more precise points were fashioned it might be wise to go home "to cut our Grass" rather than take up matters "by halves." Whether Jay and his supporters were bluffing or were confident that time was on their side would be anyone's educated guess. When Governor Clinton, the Convention's presiding officer, seemed to call the bluff and asked Jay why he did not then move to adjourn, Jay responded by insisting that Clinton's side spend some time in clarifying their notion of direct taxes.

The very next day saw Jay take the floor to make one of his most telling speeches, when he insisted that "a government which was to accomplish national purposes should command the national resources." Would it be right, he asked, for the interest of a part to supplant that of the whole? Distinguishing between general and specific taxes, he argued that, as regards the latter, Congress would be sufficiently informed to make appropriate decisions. As he saw it, no minute knowledge was required to impose taxes on luxuries--for example, a tax on coaches (thereby anticipating Hamilton's carriage tax), or slaves, or plate. Recognizing that some ambiguity existed over the question of concurrent jurisdiction over taxation, Jay was prepared to have an explanatory clause incorporated. "I may be cured by an explanatory amendment," McKesson quotes him as conceding.

The Antifederalists now moved beyond seeking to curb Congress' taxing power, aiming as well to curb the power of the federal government to borrow money. Lansing would have required nine states to acquiesce. Jay swiftly rose to his feet to point out that "factions" not unknown to "republican governments" might prevent a third of Congress from allowing the other two-thirds from obtaining a loan "when the Exigencies of the State required it or when it would be for the public Good." Even foreign nations might try to prevent Congress from borrowing money in the national interest. Jay then informed Governor Clinton that, unlike the Senate, where the two-thirds rule was in force for treaties and impeachment, the lower house had nothing to do with treaties; it represented the people whereas the Senate represented the states--for the Federalists always a significant distinction. As for impeachment, the two-thirds rule was designed to prevent factions from removing officials for political reasons. Frequently Jay struck a sectional note. In case of a war the Western states would have the power to refuse a loan to support the defense of the Atlantic states, the most likely targets and sufferers in such an eventuality. "Would you put it in the power of five men to disarm a Continent?," he asked. At this point, Hamilton reinforced Jay's arguments in a powerful address, stressing national security considerations in supporting a loan by majority vote.

Differences over textual matters, amendments compounding amendments--nothing could spoil an Independence Day celebration in Poughkeepsie. Despite unsettled weather, (it had been steadily raining for days) both factions celebrated a feast together--that is, not quite together. As Jay described it, "two tables, but in different Houses" were laid out for the delegates, but "the two Parties mingled at each Table" and toasts were announced "by sound of Drum, accompanied by the Discharge of Cannon." [_Jay to Sarah Jay, July 5, 1788,_ [4019](/jay/ldpd:28556) (no image)]. After this display of patriotic good will, the two parties settled down to continue their dissection of the Constitution. How different was the celebration of July 4th in Albany, where Federalists and Antifederalists clashed, with one dead and eighteen participants wounded! [_Jay to Washington, July 8, 1788,_ [10400](/jay/ldpd:66914)].

As of July 4th, Jay could write John Adams that despite the "many amendments proposed by the opposition...we proceed with much Temper and moderation. I am not without Hopes of an accomodation altho my expectations of it are not very sanguine." [_Jay to Adams, July 4, 1788,_ [6420](/jay/ldpd:41856), [7467](/jay/ldpd:48306)] As he remarked to another correspondent that same day, there was reason for cautious optimism since the people of the southern part of the state were "with great unanimity" advocates of the Constitution." "Meantime ratification by the other states proceeds." With this trend in public opinion Jay felt free to predict that the opposition would seek "some line of accomodation that they may acquit them with their Partizans." Whether this face-saving would involve "_conditional_" or "_recommendatory_" amendments was still not clear.[_Jay to Francis Corbin, July 4, 1788,_ [12844](/jay/ldpd:78740)] That same day Jay dispatched a congratulatory note to Washington on Virginia's ratification. "The constitution," he assured the general, "constantly gains advocates among the People, and its Enemies in the Convention seem to be much embarrassed." [_Jay to Washington, July 4, 1788,_ [10399](/jay/ldpd:66922)]

By the eighth of July the delegates sitting as a Committee of the Whole had completed their examination of the Constitution, allowing Jay to write Washington that "the ground of _Rejection_" seemed to be "entirely deserted," with the opposition reported to be divided on whether to insist on "_previous_ conditional amendments," or on "subsequent ones," to which latter view the "greater number" were disposed.[_Jay to Washington, July 8, 1788,_ [10400](/jay/ldpd:66914)]

By the tenth of July some 55 amendments had been proposed, which Lansing's motion would have grouped into three categories: explanatory, conditional, and recommendatory. To deal both with the issue of the nature of ratification as well as the amendments a fourteen-man committee was appointed. On the Federalist side it included Jay, James Duane, John Sloss Hobart, Peter Lefferts, and Richard Hatfield. The Antifederalists were represented by Robert Yates, Lansing, Melancton Smith, Thomas Tredwell, John Haring, Samuel Jones, and Gilbert Livingston. What happened in committee was not included in the official reports but appears in the _New York Daily Advertiser_ of July 15th, quoting from a letter from Poughkeepsie, "dated in the morning of the 11th instant": "When the committee met, Mr. Jay declared that the word _conditional_ should be erased before there could be any decision on the merits of the amendment; this occasioned about an hour's debate, and the Antis determining not to give up that point, the committee was dissolved without effecting any Thing." Backed by Judge Hobart and other Federalist colleagues, Jay argued that a conditional ratification amounted "to a virtual and total rejection of the Constitution, and declared that they could not consult with them at all, if they insisted upon that point." "Both parties were firm," the report concluded, and the committee disbanded without reaching an agreement.

That afternoon Jay reported to the Convention the failure of the informal committee to agree. "No plan of conciliation has been formed," he confessed, "and no measure taken." Jay laid the blame at the door of the Antifederalists for "adhering rigidly to the principle of conditional adoption, which was inadmissible and absurd." According to the correspondent, "he went into a consideration of the nature and tendency of such an adoption, compared it with the powers delegated to the Convention, as well as to the powers of the future Congress, and inferred that [a conditional ratification] would amount to a total rejection." He called on the opposition repeatedly to answer his arguments. The very next morning Jay opened the Convention's business by charging "the unfairness of the proceedings of the informal Committee," and registering the complaint that "when met for mutual discussion they had only been insulted by a complete set of propositions in a dictatorial manner for their passive acquiescence."

That same day, July 11th, Jay moved that the Constitution be ratified with such explanatory amendments as were deemed useful to be recommended. Jay was reported as having spoken "forcibly" and commanded "great attention." Chancellor Livingston, Chief Justice Morris, and Hamilton spoke in support of the motion, with Melancton Smith leading the opposition. One correspondent described the speeches of the Federalists as "masterly" and "animated" and reported that they "made sensible impressions on the minds of such Antifederalist members, who have not yet rendered their conceptions entirely callous, by pre-conceived prejudice, to the voice of truth--to sound and eloquent reasoning." Thus, "the great question," as one correspondent noted, was the adoption of the Constitution without conditions before any decision could be reached on the Lansing amendment.

The debate initiated on July 11th by Jay's motion continued for four full days. As this phase of the debates was drawing to a close by July 15th, Hamilton conceded that his side was willing "to go as far as they thought safe, in recommendatory and explanatory amendments." He then read a "list of amendments"--some thirteen in all--he and his side were prepared to support. Jay announced his backing for the Hamilton list. "We are endeavouring to agree," he remarked. "Gentlemen, see we have brought forth valuable amendments." He then suggested that the number of the original list of amendments be "pared down" to achieve a consensus, indicating that both sides now seemed to be in an accommodating mood.

As the debate drew to a close, Smith moved that the Constitution be ratified _on condition_ that a _second convention_ be called to consider amendments limiting out-of-state activities by the militia, restricting the power of Congress to determine the time, place, and manner of elections, prohibiting federal excises, "ardent spirits excepted," as well as the laying of direct taxes by Congress "within this state."

Jay responded by noting that the issues raised by Smith were matters to be decided by the people, not by their agents or attorneys. He followed the very next day with an eloquent plea for accommodation in which he praised some of the proposed amendments as "valuable," while urging that the number be pared down to achieve a consensus. In one of his longer and more compelling arguments delivered the following day, Jay urged the defeat of the conditional amendments proposal. He pointed out that since Congress had no power to change any part of the Constitution, such a conditional ratification would have the effect "of necessity" of New York's remaining out of the Union. Then he struck a characteristic note combining conciliation and caution:

We are sent here on a most important occasion [by] Our Constituents calmly to consider and wisely to decide on the proposition before us. We were sent here to serve general Purposes and promote public Good. We should reason together; let us reason first and decide afterwards. This Constitution is the work of freemen who have given to the world the Highest Evidence of Patriotism, disinterestedness, wisdom and great Abilities. Therefore let us examine Cautiously before we reject.

Jay then proceeded to point out that ten states had already ratified, after having argued the merits at length. "It has grown too fast to be pulled up by the Roots." Should we remain out of the Union, what, he asked would be the internal condition of the state of New York? How about the attitude of our neighbor states? Meantime, the federal government will be organizing, laws will be made, and New York have no hand in either activity. Consider the benefits, he reminded his listeners, of Congress sitting in New York and of the U.S. treasury and mint being located there, of the amount of specie which the presence of the federal government will bring into the state. Let us remember, he counseled, that "many men of virtue" in other states have found amendments desirable. "The door is open. Let us agree," he urged in his peroration. "_We_ will have our Constitution and _you_ will have your Amendments."

It was Melancton Smith who on July 17th brought the Convention into focus by proposing a resolution supporting the ratification of the Constitution under Article V, while reserving the right to withdraw within an unspecified number of years if the Constitution was not amended in a second convention to be called by the New York legislature with a circular letter to the other states setting forth the reasons for the call. After adjourning until the next day, the Convention once more went into a committee of the whole. "The Party seemed embarrassed, fearful to divide among themselves, and yet many of them were very averse to the new plan," Jay reported cheerfully to Washington.[_Jay to Washington, July 17, 1788,_ [10601](/jay/ldpd:68510), [8432](/jay/ldpd:54352)]. "It is difficult to conjecture what may be done out of doors today," Jay added, but a good deal must have been accomplished off the floor, and recent scholars, reflecting the testimony of Antifederalists, attributed the bulk of it to Jay's persuasive voice.

Jay, with support from Hamilton, closed the debate on the Smith motion by reiterating the point that conditional ratification amounted to "no ratification." Proposing amendments to the Constitution _subsequent_ to its ratification was a proposition always acceptable to Jay, even though he had contested some of the proposed amendments which struck at the heart of the federal government's ability to function. Thus, when on July 22d "the declaratory part of the proposed Bill of Rights came up for consideration, both Jay and Hamilton, according to a newspaper correspondent, "made some objections, if I recollected aright, to the wording of the several political maxims, and contended that some of them were not expressed with precision and accuracy, although they were truths to which they readily yielded their assent." As regards the amendment earlier proposed curbing a standing army or control of the militia by the federal government, Jay argued against such curbs as being counter to "the dictates of œconomy; for that on such occasions the government, contemplating their full and entire direction of the militia, would avoid the raising or the increase of their standing forces, to the degree that the national emergencies might otherwise require; and that the dictates of safety were against it. For, as he and Mr. Hamilton, I think, both observed, the surest way to force government into the necessity of maintaining armies, was by fettering their authority over the militia."

From the beginning Jay had made it clear that he sympathized with those who felt that the Constitution might well be improved by amendments which would be in order following its adoption and in accordance with its own provisions. Thus, in the debates on a Bill of Rights, Jay asked why the proponents did not list all the unalienable rights but only singled out three, and he made a point of opposing extending the exemption to bearing arms to conscientious objectors other than Quakers. However, four days later, on July 22d, Jay seconded Melancton Smith's motion for an amendment setting a maximum eight-year term for President. He supported this proposition over Hamilton's opposition on the ground that the amendment prevented a President for running for a third term. Indeed, Jay would soon introduce an amendment of his own.

The Convention was fast approaching its climax. By July 23d Jay could write Washington that the Convention by a vote of 31 to 29 had adopted the motion of Samuel Jones and stricken out the words "on condition," substituting "in full confidence." He cautioned nonetheless that the opposition planned "to rally their forces" for a last stand.[_Jay to Washington, July 23, 1788,_ [12498](/jay/ldpd:78316), [5349](/jay/ldpd:35708)] On July 24th Jay took the floor to express the hope that unanimous agreement could be reached for a second convention, striking a harmonious note: "We are now one people, all pledged for amendments." Toward the very end of the ratifying convention, on July 25th, Jay himself proposed an amendment barring all except "natural born citizens," who were freeholders as well (with some specified exceptions) from eligibility as President, Vice President, or as members of either house of Congress, a restriction even more severe than that which he had proposed to Washington in July of 1787\. Lansing's effort to delete the restriction to freeholders was defeated, and Jay's proposed amendment was adopted by a large majority, to be included in the final list of recommendatory amendments submitted by the Convention. Fortunately for the country this proposed amendment, like so many of the others recommended at Poughkeepsie, was never incorporated into the Constitution, for the nation would have been deprived of the contributions of some of Congress' most talented members. Finally, during the wind-up sessions, Jay indicated a willingness to have the Bill of Rights "expressly" reserve to the states and the people "all the rights not granted in the Constitution," a major concession to states'-rights sentiment that finally appeared in the 10th Amendment.

Shortly thereafter a committee comprising Jay, Lansing, and Melancton Smith was charged with preparing a Circular Letter to the Governors of the other states (28 July 1788). Jay's principal authorship seems likely since we have a copy in his hand in the McKesson Papers, and he was far and away the most experienced draftsman of the three. The Circular Letter struck that conciliatory note that characterized Jay's consistent performance:

> We observe that amendments have been proposed and are anxiously desired by several of the states as well as by this; and we think it of great Importance that effectual means be immediately taken for calling a Convention to meet at a Period not far remote....It cannot be necessary to observe that no Government, however constituted, can operate well, unless it possesses the Confidence and good will of the Body of the People.

The letter was agreed to unanimously. But the battle was not quite over. The Convention had to vote down a new motion by Lansing reserving the right of the state to secede if the amendments were not adopted. Lansing's motion was defeated by the perilously close vote of 31 to 28, and by almost the same slim margin of 30 to 27 the Convention ratified the Constitution, with Antifederalists, including Gilbert Livingston, Melancton Smith, and Samuel Jones switching to the Federalist side while seven Antifederalists abstained.

In sum, it now appears that the objections to the Constitution on the part of the majority of the Antifederalists were never so deepseated that they could not be resolved by compromise short of conditional ratification. The sequence of events by which the Union had become a fait accompli before New York's final vote weighed heavily on the delegates at Poughkeepsie. The prospect that New York City might go it alone, isolating the rest of the state and costing it substantial revenue, along with the city's own concern that it might not be chosen as the seat of the new government should the state not ratify, seem to have been substantial, if intangible, considerations. Above all, however, the cause of the Constitution owed most to the fact that men of good will remained conciliatory and flexible, willing to be persuaded by better arguments.

In that victory no inconsiderable part was played by the universally respected, conciliatory, openminded, and persuasive Jay. From the start of the Poughkeepsie Convention he had been prepared to consider amendments. He proposed one of his own and seconded another, openly differing with Hamilton as regards the latter. Furthermore, Jay's willingness to accept "some express reservation of state rights amounted to a major concession, one that would be implemented by Madison's carefully-phrased Tenth Amendment.

Finally, in drafting the Circular Letter calling for a second convention, Jay went further in meeting the Antifederalist opposition than did any of the Federalist leaders present at ratifying conventions in the other states. Indeed, while four other state conventions had called for amendments, New York alone added to its list of recommended amendments a call upon Congress for another convention under the procedures set forth in Article V of the Constitution. In sum, when a correspondent in a Boston newspaper listed Jay among those not showing "blind idolatry for the Constitution," he could justifiably point to the conciliatory posture Jay had taken at Poughkeepsie.

Jay's Circular Letter proved unwelcome news to James Madison, who expressed the fear that it would have "a most pestilent tendency." Indubitably, the Circular Letter proved a fillip to Antifederalists not only in New York, but in Virginia and Pennsylvania as well, while definitely encouraging the opposition in holdout states like North Carolina and Rhode Island to delay ratification. Even in the short run Madison's fears of the ill effects of Jay's Circular Letter proved unfounded. In Jay's own state, despite the campaign launched on 30 October by a group of "Federal Republicans" headed by Customs Collector John Lamb and including Melancton Smith, sentiment was already moving in a contrary direction. A fortnight earlier Jay had been able to report to Edward Rutledge that the temper of the opposition, once "violent," had "daily become more moderate." While the proposal for a second convention should, in Jay's judgment "terminate all questions on the subject. If immediately carried," he observed, "its friends will be satisfied, and if convened three years hence, little danger, perhaps some good will attend it."

The proposal for a second convention was also advanced by a Pennsylvania Antifederalist Convention called in Harrisburg in September 1788, and by the Virginia legislature, but, when the proposition came before the House of Representatives in May 1789, Madison swiftly responded by systematically pruning and styling the various and numerous amendments submitted by the ratifying conventions and reduced them in number to a Bill of Rights. Their adoption cut the ground from under the move for a second convention, although this mode of ratification has found its proponents from time to time.

As for Jay, we know from his own admission that he was not displeased that the country did not rush into the second convention.[_Jay to Washington, September 21, 1788,_ [10406](/jay/ldpd:66884)] Soon to be Chief Justice, he would have a Constitution to interpret, and uncertainty and instability were the last things that he and his Federalist colleagues would have desired.
