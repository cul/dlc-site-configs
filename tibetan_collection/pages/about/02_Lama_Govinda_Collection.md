Lama Anagarika Govinda (1898-1985), born Ernst Lothar Hoffmann, was the founder of the order of the Arya Maitreya Mandala and a teacher of Buddhist meditation, as well as a painter and poet. For many years, Lama Govinda lived in Sri Lanka and then India, offering spiritual direction to a great number of western Buddhist students. A European intellectual and artist, he experienced much of the history of that time both as a participant (a soldier in WWI and a non-combatant prisoner of war in WWII), and from the 1930s as an observer of the system of beliefs that Tibetan Buddhism represented. In 1947, he married the Parsi artist Li Gotami, who was from Bombay and had been his student at Santiniketan in 1934.

In 2013, Ken Winkler, professor of English Literature at Santa Monica College and biographer of the late Lama Govinda, donated his research materials and notes, as well as books and other items contributed by Li Gotami, wife of Lama Govinda. The C.V. Starr East Asian Library is grateful for Mr. Winkler's consideration and pleased to preserve these materials in its [Special Collections](https://library.columbia.edu/libraries/eastasian/special_collections/tibetan-rare-books---special-collections/govinda.html).
