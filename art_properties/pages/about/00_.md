Art Properties, based in Avery Architectural & Fine Arts Library, oversees Columbia University's art collection. Comprised of more than 13,000 works of art in all media, across multiple time periods and cultures worldwide, the collection is available for research and study, curricular use, and educational  programs, and may be requested as external loans for special exhibitions. This curated digital project of over 500 works from the collection provides just a glimpse at the vast holdings in the University art collection. Highlights include: portrait paintings and modern art; daguerreotypes and other historic and modern examples of photography; drawings, watercolors, and prints by artists worldwide; historic  Buddhist art from India, China, Tibet, and Japan, and numerous other examples of fine and decorative art from Asia; and archaeological artifacts from the Ancient Near East, the Aegean world, and ancient  Rome and Etruria.

This collection will grow over time as more high-resolution digital imaging takes place.
