The secondary navigation only creates a dropdown if there is more than one link with a given group value. There is one exception to this rule: The permanent link, which has the extra layer to alleviate confusion. This page could go away if the secondary navigation in the mockups, which has a dropdown for "Help", is negotiable. It includes three text blocks to facilitate layout development. One of them, which immediately follows this one, doesn't have a label at the time of this writing.
